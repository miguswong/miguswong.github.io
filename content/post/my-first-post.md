## Introduction

Hey Everyone,

My name is Migus Wong. I am creating this website with hugo for my Week 2 assignment with for [MSDS 431 - Data Engineering with Go!](https://msdsgo.netlify.app/data-engineering-with-go/#:~:text=This%20comprehensive%20introduction%20to%20the%20Go%20programming%20language%20reviews%20data) However, this is something that I have been wanting to do for a while so I look forward to adding more content onto the webpage and using this site to track my personal projects personal endeavors.

Ultimately, this website was created with the use of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). While the Hugo community is huge and there is plenty of documentation out there for utilizing git pages and Hugo, I prefer video-style tutorials; this was the one that I followed along with.

If you are interested in creating a website that looks like this, I would highly suggest checking out [the Hugo Clarity Theme](https://github.com/chipzoller/hugo-clarity) which also included a an example site to get you started building out your website.
